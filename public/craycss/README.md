# craycss
A dark theme oriented CSS library meant to replicate Discord's look.

## Mobile first? 
No. If you want mobile-responsiveness, you should include this and Bootstrap together.

## Discord themed?
To get a feel of what we want it to look like, check out https://discordapp.com/

## CDN?
Not yet but hopefully soon.

Just add cray.css as a stylesheet, not any different from Bootstrap or other CSS libraries and visit the craytesting.html for examples.

## Created 2 years ago?
Yes, this project was abandoned by myself, but since people have been starring it and forking it, I've decided to start updating it again. Please give feedback.
